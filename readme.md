# Welcome to my multiverse bootcamp project files!

## Setup
Clone the repo, then

```
npm i
```
to install dependencies.

## Running tasks
Until I implement a more interactive method of running tasks, please simply run

```
node familyTree/
```

from the project's root directory and of course, replace `familyTree/` with the name of any task folder.
